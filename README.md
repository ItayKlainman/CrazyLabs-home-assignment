# Seeking Missile Feature 
Built a fun seeking missile system for a Unity puzzle game! This feature lets players fire missiles that automatically target and destroy blocks. I implemented intelligent targeting with a centralized manager to prevent multiple missiles from hitting the same target, added object pooling for smooth performance, and created configurable settings so designers can easily tweak missile behavior. Along the way, I solved some interesting challenges like missiles getting stuck in targeting loops and UI buttons not resetting properly between levels. The final result is clean, maintainable code that works smoothly across all game levels. It was a great learning experience in game architecture, performance optimization, and debugging complex systems!
